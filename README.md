# PartyPlannerPro
## Welcome to Party Planner Pro
Party Planner Pro will help you keep track of all of the moving parts for your events. Users are able to create and edit customer events with 
their vendors and venues. Users can find venues by city and vendors by category or city.  Using the calendar feature, users can see all of their 
upcoming events by date range including a list of past events.  When in the customer list, users can not only access their customer information
they can also see a list of that customer's events and see a graph which lets you know which customers generate the most revenue.
